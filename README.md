About Us:
Sweat is a social media web application that aims to connect athletes
and fitness enthusiasts with other like minded individuals!
Sweat aims to take insperation from other, well known, social media
applications such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit.

General Layout:
Most of our insperation for the design comes from twitter where we
really like how the welcoming page, sign up, sign in and the landing
page flowed together. 

Welcoming Page (Jose):

Sign Up (Kyle):
The Sign Up page honestly has more fields than I'd like as while 
looking at examples for insperation and styles to implement every
website kept the sign up very simple (First Name, Last Name, Email,
Username, Password, though rarley some did have age and gender). As 
I originally wanted to have a quick pop-up on the welcoming page
just like twitter but found the enlarged form with all the requirements
looked out of place. I used the darker outline to try and 'focus' the
users eyes towards the form and I also wanted to keep the single line 
per entry that twitters sign up follows as it keeps everything legible
and easy for users of all ages.

Sign In (Jose):

Landing(Jose & Kyle):

User Content Feed (Kyle):
For the content feed most of the insperation agian comes from twitter
giving the users a straight forward feed that allows them to see the 
content of the desired content creators in a simple (Scroll down for 
more) style. I followed W3 tutorials and refered to classwork to format 
the feed to something that I felt was presenable. Originally I had the 
header follow the users scroll but agreed with Jose that the lower parts
of the page looked better without. 

Navigation and Sidebars (Jose):
